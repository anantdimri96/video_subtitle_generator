# 🎬 Auto Caption Generator 🧠

Tired of **bad subtitles ruining your videos**? I was too. So I built **Auto Caption Generator** — a lightweight AI web app that **auto-generates perfectly synced captions** and burns them into your videos.

## 🤯 The Problem
Tired of bad subtitles ruining your videos? So was I. That’s why I built Auto Caption Generator — a lightweight AI web app that automatically generates and burns subtitles into your videos, in perfect sync.

Subtitles matter: accessibility, comprehension, global audiences.  
But most tools are:  
- 💸 Expensive  
- 🤯 Clunky  
- 🐢 Slow  
- 😩 Out of sync  

Frustrating, right? I wanted **something simple and reliable**.

## 💡 The Solution

**Auto Caption Generator** does it all:  
1. Upload a short video  
2. AI transcription (Whisper)  
3. Time-aligned subtitles (SRT)  
4. Burn captions directly into video  
5. Preview & download  

No manual syncing. No extra tools. Just working subtitles.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Video Upload
->
Audio Extraction (MoviePy)
->
Speech-to-Text (OpenAI Whisper)
->
Timestamped Segments
->
SRT Generation
->
Subtitle Burn-in (ffmpeg)
->
Browser Playback + Download

## 🧠 AI & Product Decisions

From an **AI Product Manager perspective**, this project involved several deliberate tradeoffs:

### Model Choice
- **Whisper (base)** was chosen to balance:
  - Transcription accuracy
  - Latency
  - CPU-only inference (no GPU dependency)

### Infrastructure Constraints
- Deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud (free tier)**
- CPU-only environment → influenced model size and upload limits
- File size capped at **10 MB** to ensure reliability and predictable performance

### UX Decisions
- Immediate validation for file size
- In-browser video playback for instant feedback
- Minimal UI to reduce cognitive load
- Downloadable output for real-world usability

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend / App Framework:** Streamlit
- **Speech-to-Text:** OpenAI Whisper
- **Video Processing:** MoviePy, ffmpeg
- **Subtitle Formatting:** srt
- **Deployment:** GitHub + Streamlit Community Cloud

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- CPU-only inference → slower for longer videos
- Optimised for short-form content
- Single-language transcription (English by default)
- Not designed for batch processing (yet)

These limitations are intentional, aligned with free-tier constraints and product simplicity.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

If evolving this into a more production-grade AI product:
- Language selection & multilingual subtitles
- Subtitle styling (font, size, color, positioning)
- Async processing with progress indicators
- Batch uploads
- User authentication & history
- Cost-aware scaling strategies
